# Assignment3_EDA
Just learned PySpark from the course https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-essentials-sql-python-and-spark/?couponCode=ST8MT220425G3 and also from YouTube link https://youtu.be/_C8kWso4ne4?si=720XUKkFPYKaJlvN. So doing assignment wasn't a easy task. You have recently learned a technology and doing an assignment.
But while doing the assignment was able to learn different functions other than what taught in course like Window function, how to use SQL functions in PySpark, how does GroupBy function and OrderBy function works with each other.
Learned how to add column with adding conditions.
I got difficulty in how to download the csv in local data. I searched through web and got the command for the same.
